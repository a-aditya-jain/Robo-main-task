I have 234 passwords stored I am not going to input them one by one. 3-4-22 Thanks for your reply but I've moved on to another app. But why wouldn't there be an import function inside the app itself like every other password manager?

here you can find the instructions how to import your passwords:

Auto fill works good with Chrome. I'm assuming it will with Edge Chromium too. Separate toggles for app auto fill and browser auto fill is very much appreciated. Suggestions: 1. The phone apps dont seem to have a password generator and I think a password generator should be added. 2. The cost of the pro subscription seems a bit high (considering Bitwarden's price),3,19,2022-02-20 12:02:46,"Thank you for your feedback.
